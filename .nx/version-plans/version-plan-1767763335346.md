nx-cdk: minor

Added support for shared infrastructure stacks in the nx-cdk preset. This feature allows you to define common infrastructure resources (like VPCs, databases, caches, etc.) in a separate stack that can be referenced by multiple service stacks. The shared infrastructure stack is automatically integrated into the generated application structure, with proper prop passing between the shared infrastructure and service stacks.

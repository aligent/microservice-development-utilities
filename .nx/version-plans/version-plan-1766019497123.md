Add `HttpResponseError` class for detailed HTTP error information, similar to Axios Error. The retry middleware now throws structured errors with:

- HTTP status code and status text
- Full request and response objects
- Type guard function `isHttpResponseError()` for TypeScript type narrowing
- `toJson()` method for structured logging
